==== Permissions ====

MythicDrops has some permissions per tier as well. If you want a player to be able to spawn your
    Rare tier, then give them "mythicdrops.command.spawn.rare" as well as "mythicdrops.command.spawn",
    and they'll be able to spawn that tier. If someone does not have "mythicdrops.command.spawn.wildcard",
    they cannot spawn every tier. This enables you to give certain players the ability to spawn items.

==== Commands ====

MythicDrops has one base command and then multiple subcommands. As the modules installed can
    change the commands that the plugin uses, only the basic command is listed here. You
    can use "/mythicdrops" in game to see a full list of commands.
